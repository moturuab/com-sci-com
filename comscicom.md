## Direct Submissions

If you want to submit directly via MarkUs please include your submission in a single md + PDF if possible.

Make sure you submit markdown and any media you produced (images, animations, diagrams, gifs).

Give visual content a description. Include technical explanation that would allow anyone in our course to understand the concept being visualized.

Include mathematical details with inline $\LaTeX$.

You should link out to external resources. However, those should be supplementary, your submission should try to summarize the important aspects so that your submission is as self-contained as reasonable.
